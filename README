EXPORTS
    This module provides the following exports:

    `$REST' App::Dochazka::REST singleton object

METHODS AND ROUTINES
  `reset_db'
    Drop and re-create a Dochazka database. Takes database name. Do not call
    when connected to an existing database. Be very, _very_, _VERY_ careful
    when calling this function.

  init
    Load site configuration, set up logging, and connect to the database.

  init_no_db
    Load site configuration and set up logging. Intended for use from the
    `init' method as well as from App::Dochazka::REST unit tests that need
    to connect to the pristine database using `connect_db_pristine'.

    Takes an optional PARAMHASH which is passed to `$CELL->load'. The
    App::Dochazka::REST distro sharedir is loaded as the first sitedir,
    before any sitedir specified in the PARAMHASH is loaded. Call examples:

        my $status = $REST->init_no_db;
        my $status = $REST->init_no_db( verbose => 1 );
        my $status = $REST->init_no_db( sitedir => '/etc/fooapp' );

    (The first example should be sufficient.)

  connect_db_pristine
    Connect to a pristine database. This function should be used only for
    newly created databases. Takes a PARAMHASH with 'dbname', 'dbuser', and
    'dbpass'. For username and password, DBINIT_CONNECT_USER and
    DBINIT_CONNECT_AUTH are used.

  connect_db
    Connect to a pre-initialized database and initialize site params. This
    is the function that should be used in production. Takes database name.
    For username and password, DOCHAZKA_DBUSER and DOCHAZKA_DBPASS are used.

  create_tables
    Execute all the SQL statements contained in DBINIT_CREATE param

  eid_of_root
    Instance method. Returns EID of the 'root' employee.
